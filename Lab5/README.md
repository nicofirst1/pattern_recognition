Lab 5: Assignment 1

The first assignment investigates the performance of the LVQ1 algorithm on the given data set. The files 'data_lvq_A.mat' and 'data_lvq_B.mat' each contain 100 two-dimensional feature vectors, belonging to class A and B, respectively. Your task is to build a LVQ1 classifier using this training data.
Test
Lab 5: Assignment 2

In this assignment your task is to code a 10-fold cross validation process for the estimation of the classification error in the previous assignment.
Test
Lab 5: Assignment 3

The last part of the practical will use the already implemented algorithms in the Assignment 1 & 2. Here you are asked to modify the LVQ1 to the Relevance LVQ and apply the 10-fold cross validation to the data set.
